Aerodynamics was an unexplored concept at the start of formula 1 however it has now evolved to be an incredibly significant of car design.
Over the years the sport has produced innovative solutions like Drag reduction systems and components specifically designed to generate
downforce. This article explores how Formula 1 teams have been able to optimise car performance within the constraints of the regulations and
how regulation changes opened possibilities for further development and the importance of testing in order to further improve the sport.

Every year new regulations are introduced to maintain safety in the sports but also to keep the sport unpredictable and exciting (Morlidge,2022).
In 2022 Formula 1 had one of the biggest regulation changes. The aim of the regulation changes was to allow closer racing and increasing the potential 
for overtakes. At that time the biggest challenge for racing was downforce loss due to the dirty air from the car ahead. Data shows that a F1 car loses
35% of downforce when being three car lengths behind a car and 47% when being one car length behind. However, with the regulation changes that figure has 
decreased to 4% when being three car length behind and only 18% when being one car length behind (Stuart,2021). In 2022 a new front wing shape was introduced 
with its job being to generate downforce and allow the car to be able to follow behind closely, while ensuring that the dirty air is being steered narrowly 
down the sides of the car. The ground effect was also reintroduced however was different from how it was used in the 1970s as instead of having side skirts the 
2022 car had underfloor tunnels which allowed cars to generate downforce through the ground effect. The downforce was kept within the tunnels and therefore did 
not rely on sending vortices to increase downforce like previous cars this therefore allowed for closer racing (Stuart, 2021).

     <h3 id="Aerodynamic Testing">Aerodynamic Testing</h3>
     <p>
<pre>
One of the main aspects of aerodynamic evolution is the use of technology to do testing such as CFD and wind tunnelling. CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) is
technology that analyses things such as airflow and heat transfer. It works on the idea of collecting data and linking them to mathematical equations to predict 
what is happening in the flow field. Usually, to verify the accuracy it is then tested in wind tunnels. (Wang et al,2018). CFD is a cheaper alternative to having 
to build prototypes to test however since it is a simulation results are not always accurate (Gere Gurky and Adhitya,2024). In 2022 formula 1 teams had over 7500 
simulations. Testing was done in saubers wind tunnels having experimented 138 base configurations and around 100 wind on hours. (Stuart,2021).  Aerodynamic testing 
is a powerful tool and therefore testing time has been limited since 2021 and is dependent on Championship position with teams finishing first having the less time and 
teams finishing first getting the most time, this evens out the playing field between teams and controls costs (Barretto,2025).

In 2026 comes big changes again with new regulations again being introduced that will likely change the field. They will introduce a new active 
aerodynamics system that will include moveable front and rear wings. The front wing is also undergoing changes with it being 100mm narrower. DRS 
is also replaced with a new system called MOM (Manual Override Mode). This system includes two modes the first mode is called Z-mode, and it is when 
the front and rear wings are opened and angled for better cornering speed. The second mode is X-Mode which changes the flap angle to maximise straight line
speed (Barretto,2025).All of these aerodynamic changes have been designed in order to ensure for closer racing. With these new regulations emerging, engineers 
will need to be on top of their game in order to compete (Clark,2025).
