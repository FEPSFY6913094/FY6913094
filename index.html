<p style= "font-family:verdana">Aerodynamics was an unexplored concept at the start of formula 1 however it has now evolved to be an incredibly significant part 
of car design. Over the year the sport has produced innovative solutions like Drag reductions systems and components specifically designed to generatedownforce. 
This article explores how formula 1 teamshave been able to optimise car performance within the constraints of the regulations and how regulation changes opened 
possibilities for further development and the importance of testing in order to further improve the sport. </p>

     <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
   <p> 
<pre>
<p style= "font-family:verdana">The start of aerodynamics was in the 1970s when the formula 1 team Lotus came up with a car design that included a nose and 
wings.The design was very successful and won the team five championships.This catalysed the start of ‘The Ground Effect’ which meant that the car was brought
closer to the ground which improved grip and performance in cornering therefore by the 1980s all teams has incorporated it into their car, however it was 
banned by the 1980s as excessive downforce was dangerous and increased the risk of accidents (Clark,2025). Nevertheless, this did not stop the evolution of 
aerodynamics, and it continued to develop for example with the introduction systems such as DRS (Drag reduction system) which allowed drivers to adjust their 
rear wing to help them overtakewhen they are within one second of the car ahead.Furthermore, front wings were designed to be relatively close to the ground and 
inverted to create the opposite effect of wings on an aeroplane, so instead of creating lift it produces downforce. It is however important to note that 
optimised aerodynamics in wing design is not solely achieved by generating downforce but by how it flows with the rest of the car (Toet,2016). In this article 
I will explore what contributes to aerodynamics evolution in the sport and how it will be evolve in the future within the constraints of the sport. </p>

     <p>
<pre> 
<p style= "font-family:verdana">Every year new regulations are introduced to maintain safety in the sports but also to keep the sport unpredictable and 
exciting (Morlidge,2022). In 2022 Formula 1 had one of the biggest regulation changes. The aim of the regulation changes was to allow closer racing and 
increasing the potential for overtakes. At that time the biggest challenge for racing was downforce loss due to the dirty air from the car ahead. Data 
shows that a F1 car loses 35% of downforce when being three car lengths behind a car and 47% when being one car length behind. However, with the 
regulation changes that figure  has decreased to 4% when being three car length behind and only 18% when being one car length behind (Stuart,2021). 
In 2022 a new front wing shape was introduced with its job being to generate downforce and allow the car to be able to follow behind closely, while
ensuring that the dirty air is being steered narrowly down the sides of the car. The ground effect was also reintroduced however was different from how
it was used in the 1970s as instead of having side skirts the 2022 car had underfloor tunnels which allowed cars to generate downforce through the ground 
effect. The downforce was kept within the tunnels and therefore did notrely on sending vortices to increase downforce like previous cars this therefore 
allowed for closer racing (Stuart, 2021).</p>

     <p>
<pre> 
<p style="font-family:Verdana">One of the main aspects of aerodynamic evolution is the use of technology to do testing such as CFD and wind tunnelling. CFD 
(Computational fluid dynamics) istechnology that analyses thingssuch as airflow and heat transfer. It works on the idea of collecting data and linking them
to mathematical equations to predict what is happening in the flow field. Usually, to verify the accuracy it is then tested in windtunnels. (Wang et al,2018). 
CFD is a cheaper alternative to having to build prototypes to test however since it is a simulation results are not always accurate (Gere Gurky and Adhitya,2024). 
In 2022 formula 1 teams had over 7500 simulations. Testing was done in saubers wind tunnels having experimented 138 base configurations and around 100 wind on 
hours. (Stuart,2021).  Aerodynamic testing is a powerful tool and therefore testing time has been limited since 2021 and is dependent on Championship position with 
teams finishing first having the less time and teams finishing first getting the most time, this evens out the playing field between teams and controls costs 
(Barretto,2025).</p>

<p style= "font-family:verdana">In 2026 comes big changes again with new regulations again being introduced that will likely change the field. They will 
introduce a new active aerodynamics system that will include moveablefront and rear wings.The front wing is also undergoing changes with it being 100mm
narrower. DRS is also replaced with a new system called MOM (Manual Override Mode). This system includes two modes the first mode is called Z-mode, and it 
is when the front and rear wings are opened and angled for better cornering speed. The second mode is X-Mode which changes the flap angle to maximise straight
line speed (Barretto,2025).All of these aerodynamicchanges have been designed in order to ensure for closer racing. With these new regulations emerging, 
engineers will need to be on top of their game in order to compete (Clark,2025).</p>
