<p style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify;">
  Aerodynamics was an unexplored concept at the start of Formula 1; however, it has now evolved into a
  significant part of car design. Over the years, the sport has produced innovative solutions such as drag reduction
  systems and components specifically designed to generate downforce. This article explores how Formula 1 teams have
  been able to optimise car performance within the constraints of regulations, how regulatory changes have opened
  possibilities for further development, and the importance of testing in improving aerodynamics.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify;">
  The start of aerodynamics in Formula 1 began in the 1970s when the Lotus team introduced a car design that included a 
  nose and wings. The design proved highly successful and won the team five championships. This catalysed the beginning 
  of the “ground effect” era, where cars were brought closer to the ground to improve grip and cornering performance. 
  By the 1980s, all teams had incorporated ground-effect principles into their cars, however it was later banned due 
  to the excessive downforce it produced which increased the risk of accidents <a href="#References">(Clark, 2025)</a>.
  Nevertheless, this did not stop the evolution of aerodynamics. Development continued with the introduction of systems 
  such as DRS (Drag Reduction System), which allows drivers to adjust their rear wing to improve overtaking when they 
  are within one second of the car ahead. Additionally, front wings were also designed to sit close to the ground and inverted to 
  create the opposite effect of an aeroplane wing, generating downforce instead of lift. It is important to note that optimised 
  wing aerodynamics is not achieved solely by generating downforce, but also by ensuring airflow interacts efficiently with the 
  rest of the car <a href="#References">(Toet, 2016).</a>.

       <h3 id="Meeting Regulations">Meeting Regulations</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify;">
Every year new regulations are introduced to maintain safety in the sports but also to keep the sport unpredictable and 
exciting <a href="#References">(Morlidge,2022)</a>. In 2022 Formula 1 had one of the biggest regulation changes. The aim of the regulation changes was to allow for closer racing and 
increasing the potential for overtakes. At that time, the biggest challenge for racing was downforce loss due to the dirty air from the car ahead. Data 
shows that a F1 car loses 35% of downforce when being three car lengths behind a car and 47% when being one car length behind. However, with the 
regulation changes that figure has decreased to 4% when being three car length behind and only 18% when being one car length behind <a href="#References">(Stuart,2021)</a>. 
This was done as a result of introducing a new front wing shape with its job being to generate downforce and allow the car to be able to follow behind closely, while
ensuring that the dirty air is being steered narrowly down the sides of the car. The ground effect was also reintroduced however was different from how
it was used in the 1970s as instead of having side skirts the 2022 car had underfloor tunnels which allowed cars to generate downforce through the ground 
effect. The downforce was kept within the tunnels and therefore did not rely on sending vortices to increase downforce like previous cars which
allowed for closer racing <a href="#References">(Stuart, 2021)</a>.

     <h3 id="Aerodynamic Testing">Aerodynamic Testing</h3>
<p style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify;">
One of the main aspects of aerodynamic evolution is the use of technology to do testing such as CFD and wind tunnelling. CFD 
(Computational fluid dynamics) is technology that analyses things such as airflow and heat transfer. It works on the idea of collecting data and linking them
to mathematical equations to predict what is happening in the flow field. Usually, to verify the accuracy it is then tested in windtunnels <a href="#References">(Wang et al,2018)</a>. 
CFD is a cheaper alternative to having to build prototypes to test however since it is a simulation results are not always accurate <a href="#References">(Gere Gurky and Adhitya,2024)</a>. 
In 2022 formula 1 teams had over 7500 simulations. They experimented 138 base configurations and had around 100 wind on hours. <a href= "#References">(Stuart,2021)</a>. Aerodynamic testing is a powerful tool and therefore testing time has been limited since 2021 and is dependent on Championship position with 
teams finishing first having the less time and teams finishing first getting the most time, this evens out the playing field between teams and controls costs 
<a href="#References">(Barretto,2025)</a>. In the tables below you can see the advantages and drawbacks for each testing method.

<p style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify;">
In 2026 comes big changes again with new regulations again being introduced that will likely change the field. They will 
introduce a new active aerodynamics system that will include moveable front and rear wings. The front wing is also undergoing changes with it being 100mm
narrower. DRS is also replaced with a new system called MOM (Manual Override Mode). This system includes two modes the first mode is called Z-mode, and it 
is when the front and rear wings are opened and angled for better cornering speed. The second mode is X-Mode which changes the flap angle to maximise straight
line speed <a href="#References">(Barretto,2025)</a>. All of these aerodynamic changes have been designed in order to ensure for closer racing. With these new regulations emerging, 
aerodynamics evolution will continue to reach new levels. <a href="#References">(Clark,2025)</a>.

    <p style="font-family: Verdana; width: 1100px; text-align: justify;">
    In conclusion, aerodynamics has come a long way from when it first started becoming prominent in the sport. Aerodynamic evolution has happened as a response to the constant 
    changes that occur in the sport and with even more changes to happen in the future it will continue to evolve, and people will find ways to further improve the aerodynamic elements 
    with the aim of allowing for closer racing.
