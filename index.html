This paper presents a novel adaptive acting learning strategy. The most accurate classification model from a heterogenous 
classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achive greater incremnetal improvement in accuracy, compared
to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar nosaic imagery and compare it with non adaptive
active learning and traditional macine learning approaches. Our results show that..We Conclude that..

Active Learning (Angluin,1988,Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an intelligent machine through the 
interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component is an active 
system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., 
their potential to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by Commitee (Seung et al
., 1992),Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum,2001), uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale,1994) and version space reduction 
(margin sampling) (Tong and Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
presented for labelling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class labels. After adding the newly labeled
instances to the current training set, a revised model is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, 
incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continuined until some stopping criterion has been met, such as 
reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model causing the classfier confidence to drop as in 
Vlachos (2008).
